        <strong>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</strong>, born on October 15, 1931, in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, was an eminent Indian scientist and the
        11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was known as the "Missile
        Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
        launch vehicle technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalam graduated in aerospace engineering from the Madras Institute of
        Technology. He joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation
        (DRDO) and the
        <strong>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</strong>, where he
        played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military
        missile development efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Kalam's notable contributions was his work on the development of
        the Agni and Prithvi missiles, which bolstered India's defense
        capabilities. He was also instrumental in the
        <strong>Pokhran-II</strong> nuclear tests in 1998, which made India a
        nuclear-armed state.
